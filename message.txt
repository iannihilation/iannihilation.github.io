# # Dear Kasandra Nicole, 

Happy start of the "Ber" months, Kasandra! Though this letter arrived later than it was supposed to but I hope it's not late. Very ramdom Gelo meets a very secretive Kassy. Please know bay, dali ra kaayo ang adlaw. Karon September pa, tan-awa karong December ikaw pa gihapon. Akoa ipabatyag kanimo adlaw-adlaw nga angay kang higugmaon, nga dili ka lisod higugmaon. I'll hope. I'll pray. I'll wait. Please know, I will always be here. 

Always, 

-Gelo
